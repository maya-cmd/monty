# 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO :file:

## Description :Questions included:

Using extern is only of relevance when the program you're building consists of multiple source files linked together, where some of the variables defined, for example, in source file file1.c need to be referenced in other source files, such as file2.c.

It is important to understand the difference between defining a variable and declaring a variable:

A variable is declared when the compiler is informed that a variable exists (and this is its type); it does not allocate the storage for the variable at that point.

A variable is defined when the compiler allocates the storage for the variable.

You may declare a variable multiple times (though once is sufficient); you may only define it once within a given scope. A variable definition is also a declaration, but not all variable declarations are definitions.

### 2. pop
Implement the pop opcode.

The pop opcode

The opcode pop removes the top element of the stack.

Usage: pop
If the stack is empty, print the error message L<line_number>: can't pop an empty stack, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE

Usage: add
If the stack contains less than two elements, print the error message L<line_number>: can't add, stack too short, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
The result is stored in the second top element of the stack, and the top element is removed, so that at the end:
The top element of the stack contains the result
The stack is one element shorter.


### 5. nop

Implement the nop opcode.

The nop opcode

The opcode nop doesn’t do anything.

Usage: nop.
### 6.  sub

Implement the sub opcode.

The sub opcode

The opcode sub subtracts the top element of the stack from the second top element of the stack.

Usage: sub
If the stack contains less than two elements, print the error message L<line_number>: can't sub, stack too short, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
The result is stored in the second top element of the stack, and the top element is removed, so that at the end:
The top element of the stack contains the result
The stack is one element shorter

### 7. div

Implement the div opcode.

The div opcode

The opcode div divides the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack.

Usage: div
If the stack contains less than two elements, print the error message L<line_number>: can't div, stack too short, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
The result is stored in the second top element of the stack, and the top element is removed, so that at the end:
The top element of the stack contains the result
The stack is one element shorter
If the top element of the stack is 0, print the error message L<line_number>: division by zero, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE.

### 8. mul

Implement the mul opcode.

The mul opcode

The opcode mul multiplies the second top element of the stack with the top element of the stack.

Usage: mul
If the stack contains less than two elements, print the error message L<line_number>: can't mul, stack too short, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
The result is stored in the second top element of the stack, and the top element is removed, so that at the end:
The top element of the stack contains the result
The stack is one element shorter.

### 9. mod

Implement the mod opcode.

The mod opcode

The opcode mod computes the rest of the division of the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack.

Usage: mod
If the stack contains less than two elements, print the error message L<line_number>: can't mod, stack too short, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
The result is stored in the second top element of the stack, and the top element is removed, so that at the end:
The top element of the stack contains the result
The stack is one element shorter
If the top element of the stack is 0, print the error message L<line_number>: division by zero, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE.

### 10.  comments

Every good language comes with the capability of commenting. When the first non-space character of a line is #, treat this line as a comment (don’t do anything).


### 11.  pchar

Implement the pchar opcode.

The pchar opcode

The opcode pchar prints the char at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.

Usage: pchar
The integer stored at the top of the stack is treated as the ascii value of the character to be printed
If the value is not in the ascii table (man ascii) print the error message L<line_number>: can't pchar, value out of range, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
If the stack is empty, print the error message L<line_number>: can't pchar, stack empty, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE.

### 12.  pstr

Implement the pstr opcode.

The pstr opcode

The opcode pstr prints the string starting at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.

Usage: pstr
The integer stored in each element of the stack is treated as the ascii value of the character to be printed
The string stops when either:
the stack is over
the value of the element is 0
the value of the element is not in the ascii table
If the stack is empty, print only a new line.

### 13.  rotl

mplement the rotl opcode.

The rotl opcode

The opcode rotl rotates the stack to the top.

rotl never fails

### 14. rotr

Implement the rotr opcode.

The rotr opcode

The last element of the stack becomes the top element of the stack
rotr never fails

### 15. stack, queue

Implement the stack and queue opcodes.

The stack opcode

Usage: stack
The queue opcode

The opcode queue sets the format of the data to a queue (FIFO).

Usage: queue
When switching mode:
